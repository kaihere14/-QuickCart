## 📌 How It Works

- **Products** are displayed from a predefined JavaScript array.
- When you click on a product, it’s saved into `localStorage` as `data`.
- The **total price** is stored in `localStorage` under `price`.
- A `setInterval` refreshes the cart display every second, ensuring it stays updated.
- **Persistence:** Even after you close or refresh the page, the cart data stays—until you checkout or manually clear it.
